# AutoEncoder

This repo is a basic implementation of four layered autoencoder ,Where both parts encoder and decoder has 2 layers each.

Notebook starts by loading data into the dataframe and check how balanced the data is 
Fraud Transactions: 242
Normal Transaction: 113681

Input and out outputs are separated in X and Y respectivly. 

Rest of the code contains information about the implementing the encoder and decoder whcih later combined and compiled to come up with the autoencoder.
